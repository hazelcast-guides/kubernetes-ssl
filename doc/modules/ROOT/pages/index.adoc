= Hazelcast with SSL (Enterprise Only)

This a complete example presenting how to use Hazelcast Enterprise with SSL enabled on the connections between Hazelcast Members and Hazelcast Client.

include::{templates-url}/link-to-repo.adoc[]

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide you will learn how to enable SSL between Hazelcast Members and Hazelcast Client.

== Introduction

This example focuses on the security features and assumes that you have some general knowledge about:

* Hazelcast on Kubernetes:
** https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes README]
** xref:kubernetes:ROOT:index.adoc[Hazelcast on Kubernetes Guide]
** xref:kubernetes-embedded:ROOT:index.adoc[Embedded Hazelcast on Kubernetes Guide]
* Java KeyStore and TrustStore
** https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6er/index.html[Oracle's introduction to KeyStore and TrustStore]
** <<How KeyStore and TrustStore were Generated>>

The example also assumes you have a running Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` tool installed.

== 1. Create Secrets

To secure the connection between Hazelcast Server and Hazelcast Client we need to make keys available as secrets.

[source, shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic keystore --from-file=server/keystore --from-file=server/truststore
----

== 2. Start Hazelcast Cluster

Hazelcast SSL is an enterprise feature, so you need to create a secret with Hazelcast Enterprise License (if you don't have one, get a trial license key from this https://hazelcast.com/get-started/#deploymenttype-imdg[link]).

[source, shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic hz-license-key --from-literal key=<hz-license-key>
----

Then, you can start Hazelcast Cluster with the following command.

[tabs]
====

Helm::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
kubectl create configmap hazelcast-configuration --from-file=server/helm/hazelcast.yaml
helm install hz -f server/helm/values.yaml hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise
----
--

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml
kubectl create configmap hazelcast-configuration --from-file=server/kubectl/hazelcast.yaml
kubectl apply -f server/kubectl/deployment.yaml
----
--

====

You can check in the logs that Hazelcast cluster has been formed and that SSL is enabled for the communication.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl logs pod/hz-hazelcast-enterprise-0
...
INFO: [10.172.2.29]:5701 [dev] [4.0] SSL is enabled
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.244.1.3]:5702 - 8eb71540-5be6-4a06-aa2f-78492816230b this
        Member [10.244.2.4]:5702 - 53d5a2a9-f1f5-4bea-b881-0ffe48f0eea0
        Member [10.244.1.4]:5702 - f8b42a13-6944-4e94-970a-030c69e75a5b
]
----

== 3. Starting Hazelcast Client

As a client side, you'll deploy a Spring Boot application which connects to the Hazelcast cluster.

The application already includes the client configuration and `truststore`. All you need to do is to compile, package, create Docker image, and push it into your Docker Hub account. You may do it all with the following commands.

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean package -f client/pom.xml
docker build -t hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client-ssl client
docker push hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client-ssl
----

If you want to build your own Docker image, then please make sure you change `hazelcastguides` to your Docker Hub name and update `client/deployment.yaml` accordingly. Otherwise, you can use `hazelcastguides/hazelcast-client-ssl`.

Finally, you can deploy the client application.

[source, shell]
----
kubectl apply -f client/deployment.yaml
----

You can see that the client connected to the cluster using SSL by checking the logs.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl logs deployment.apps/hazelcast-client

        Member [10.244.2.4]:5701 - 53d5a2a9-f1f5-4bea-b881-0ffe48f0eea0
        Member [10.244.1.4]:5701 - f8b42a13-6944-4e94-970a-030c69e75a5b
}
...

----

Then, assuming you have Load Balancer configured for your Kubernetes environment, you can check the public IP of your client application.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get all | grep service/hazelcast-client
service/hazelcast-client   LoadBalancer   10.175.254.124   35.241.133.251   8080:31220/TCP   10m
----

Now, to check that everything works fine by executing the following commands.

[source, shell]
----
$ curl "35.241.133.251:8080/put?key=some-key&value=some-value"
{"response":null}

$ curl "35.241.133.251:8080/get?key=some-key"
{"response":"some-value"}
----

Note: In the example, we didn't use Mutual Authentication, so Hazelcast client itself was not being authorized. For more information check <<Mutual Authentication section>>.

== 4. Clean up

To delete all created resources, exucte the following commands.

[tabs]
====

Helm::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete -f client/deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f server/kubectl/deployment.yaml
kubectl delete configmap hazelcast-configuration
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes/master/rbac.yaml
kubectl delete secret keystore
kubectl delete secret hz-license-key
----
--

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl delete -f client/deployment.yaml
helm uninstall hz
kubectl delete configmap hazelcast-configuration
kubectl delete secret keystore
kubectl delete secret hz-license-key
----
--

[NOTE]
====
We used `hazelcast-mancenter` as the hostname, which means that if you start Management Center, its service must be named `hazelcast-mancenter` (otherwise the hostname verification fails).
====

=== Mutual Authentication section

SSL Mutual Authentication can be enabled to increase the security. To enable it, you need to configure it in both Hazelcast Server and Hazelcast Client.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, Mutual Authentication does not work with `livenessProbe`/`readinessProbe` enabled.
====

- Hazelcast Server

Add the following line to the ssl properties section (in hazelcast.yaml):

[source, yaml]
----
mutualAuthentication: REQUIRED
----

- Hazelcast Client

Add the following lines to the `SSLConfig` object in `hazelcastConfig()` (in the file `Application.java`):

[source, java]
----
.setProperty("keyStore", "keystore")
.setProperty("keyStorePassword", System.getEnv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"))
----

You also need to add keystore into resources by appending the following line to Dockerfile:

[source, dockerfile]
----
COPY src/main/resources/keystore keystore
----
