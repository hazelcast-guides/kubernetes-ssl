= Hazelcast with SSL (Enterprise Only)

This a complete example presenting how to use Hazelcast Enterprise with SSL enabled on the connections between Hazelcast Members and Hazelcast Client.

include::{templates-url}/link-to-repo.adoc[]

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide you will learn how to enable SSL between Hazelcast Members and Hazelcast Client.

== Introduction

This example focuses on the security features and assumes that you have some general knowledge about:

* Hazelcast on Kubernetes:
** https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[Hazelcast Kubernetes README]
** xref:kubernetes:ROOT:index.adoc[Hazelcast on Kubernetes Guide]
** xref:kubernetes-embedded:ROOT:index.adoc[Embedded Hazelcast on Kubernetes Guide]
* Java KeyStore and TrustStore
** https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6er/index.html[Oracle's introduction to KeyStore and TrustStore]
** <<How KeyStore and TrustStore were Generated>>

The example also assumes you have a running Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` tool installed.

== 1. Create Secrets

To secure the connection between Hazelcast Server and Hazelcast Client we need to make keys available as secrets.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl create secret generic keystore --from-file=server/keystore --from-file=server/truststore
----

== 2. Start Hazelcast Cluster

Hazelcast SSL is an enterprise feature, so you need to create a secret with Hazelcast Enterprise License (if you don't have one, get a trial license key from this https://hazelcast.com/get-started/#deploymenttype-imdg[link]).

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl create secret generic hz-license-key --from-literal key=<hz-license-key>
----

Then, you can start Hazelcast Cluster with the following command.

[tabs]
====

Helm::
+
--
[source, bash]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
helm install hazelcast hazelcast/hazelcast

kubectl create configmap hazelcast-configuration --from-file=server/helm/hazelcast.yaml
kubectl create configmap hazelcast-client-configuration --from-file=server/helm/hazelcast-client.yaml
helm install hazelcast -f server/helm/values.yaml hazelcast/hazelcast-enterprise
----
--

Kubectl::
+

--
[source, bash]
----
kubectl create configmap hazelcast-configuration --from-file=server/hazelcast.yaml
kubectl apply -f server/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f server/statefulset.yaml
----
--

====

You can check in the logs that Hazelcast cluster has been formed and that SSL is enabled for the communication.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl logs pod/hazelcast-0
...
INFO: [10.172.2.29]:5701 [dev] [4.0] SSL is enabled
...
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
	Member [10.172.2.29]:5701 - 633c9707-df88-4bd8-b247-3849b596b07c this
	Member [10.172.0.14]:5701 - e79cc867-2c7f-463c-a3de-fbd2129d4640
	Member [10.172.1.11]:5701 - f15a3630-5410-4e02-8c2a-0bb0b81f4639
]
----

== 2. Starting Hazelcast Client

As a client side, you'll deploy a Spring Boot application which connects to the Hazelcast cluster.

The application already includes the client configuration and `truststore`. All you need to do is to compile, package, create Docker image, and push it into your Docker Hub account. You may do it all with the following commands.

[source, shell]
----
$ mvn clean package
$ docker build -t leszko/hazelcast-client client
$ docker push leszko/hazelcast-client
----

Please change `leszko` to your Docker Hub login. Then, make sure your image in Docker Hub is public (you can do it on the https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub website]).

Now you can edit `client/deployment.yaml` and change `leszko` to your Docker Hub account and finally deploy the Hazelcast client application to Kubernetes.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f client/deployment.yaml
----

You can see that the client connected to the cluster using SSL by checking the logs.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl logs pod/hazelcast-client-9f9c9f664-4xn6z

----

Then, assuming you have Load Balancer configured for your Kubernetes environment, you can check the public IP of your client application.

[source, shell]
----
$ kubectl get all | grep service/hazelcast-client
service/hazelcast-client   LoadBalancer   10.175.254.124   35.241.133.251   8080:31220/TCP   10m
----

Now, to check that everything works fine by executing the following commands.

[source, shell]
----
$ curl "35.241.133.251:8080/put?key=some-key&value=some-value"
{"response":null}

$ curl "35.241.133.251:8080/get?key=some-key"
{"response":"some-value"}
----

Note: In the example, we didn't use Mutual Authentication, so Hazelcast client itself was not being authorized. For more information check <<Mutual Authentication section>>.

KeyStore and TrustStore files for this example were generated using the following commands:

[NOTE]
====
We used `hazelcast-mancenter` as the hostname, which means that if you start Management Center, its service must be named `hazelcast-mancenter` (otherwise the hostname verification fails).
====

=== Mutual Authentication section

SSL Mutual Authentication can be enabled to increase the security. To enable it, you need to configure it in both Hazelcast Server and Hazelcast Client.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, Mutual Authentication does not work with `livenessProbe`/`readinessProbe` enabled.
====

- Hazelcast Server

Add the following line to the ssl properties section (in hazelcast.yaml):

[source, yaml]
----
mutualAuthentication: REQUIRED
----

- Hazelcast Client

Add the following lines to the `SSLConfig` object in `hazelcastConfig()` (in the file `Application.java`):

[source, java]
----
.setProperty("keyStore", "keystore")
.setProperty("keyStorePassword", System.getEnv("KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"))
----

You also need to add keystore into resources by appending the following line to Dockerfile:

[source, dockerfile]
----
COPY src/main/resources/keystore keystore
----
